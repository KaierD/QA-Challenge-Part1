Dear Manager,

Please open the .sln file by Visual Studio, so that you could have a directly view about the code and run it simply by pressing CTRL+F5.

The 5th requirement "Print the output for all the files in a single run" confuses me a little bit. Since mentioned in the 1st point:" Create a C# script that can open up a text file", I think the script is dealing with one file each time. Therefore, the script is opening up and programming one file when the user select the file to open.

If the original purpose is opening up all the files in the selected folder, I apologize for my misunderstanding. However, just switching the OpenFileDialog to FolderBrowserDialog and adding a loop that goes through all files in the folder should make my script working for checking all files in the selected folder.


Thank you for your patience,

Kyle Dong
